## Expected Revenue

### Conservative Estimate:

```
1000 free users
  ↓ 10% convert to Enhanced
100 Enhanced users × $10 = $1,000/month
  ↓ 20% upgrade to Premium
20 Premium users × $20 = $400/month

Total: $1,400/month
```

### Optimistic Estimate:

```
5000 free users
  ↓ 15% convert to Enhanced
750 Enhanced users × $10 = $7,500/month
  ↓ 30% upgrade to Premium
225 Premium users × $20 = $4,500/month

Total: $12,000/month
```
