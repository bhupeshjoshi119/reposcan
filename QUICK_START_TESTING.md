import { generateEnhancedPDFReport } from "@/utils/enhancedPdfGenerator"

# NOT:
import { generateLimitedPDFReport } from "@/utils/limitedPdfGenerator"
```

### TypeScript errors?
```bash
npm run build
# Should show no errors
```

### PDF not generating?
```bash
# Check browser console for errors
# Check if repository data is loaded
# Try with a different repository
```

📄 Generating PDF report...
❌ Error: jsPDF is not a constructor

Perfect! Now let me test the analyze-issue command again to make sure the PDF is generated correctly:

ls -lh issue-*.pdf 2>/dev/null || echo "No PDF files found"

### delete all pdf
rm -f issue-*.pdf solution-*.pdf

## check issue
npm run analyze-issue https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/14099 2>&1 | tail -30

Good! The command works but this issue doesn't have Stack Overflow solutions. Let me try with an issue that's more likely to have solutions. Let me check what we have:

ls -lh *.pdf 2>/dev/null | head -10

Let me check the comprehensive JSON files to find an issue with Stack Overflow solutions:

cat facebook-react-comprehensive-150.json | grep -A 5 '"stackOverflowSolutions"' | head -30

2nd command
cat facebook-react-comprehensive-150.json | grep -A 5 '"stackOverflowSolutions"' | tail -10

It seems the Stack Overflow API might not be returning results. Let me create a test with mock data to demonstrate the functionality. Let me create a simple test script:

test-solution.ts

Now let's run the test to demonstrate the feature:

npx tsx test-solution-pdfs.ts

✅ Generated 3 solution PDFs

📁 Files created:
   • solution-1.pdf - Highest relevance (95%)
   • solution-2.pdf - High relevance (88%)
   • solution-3.pdf - Good relevance (82%)

   Perfect! Now let me clean up the test file and create a summary document:

    rm -f test-solution-pdfs.ts

Let me search for issues with actual solutions:

cat facebook-react-comprehensive-150.json | jq '.[] | select(.stackOverflowSolutions | length > 0) | {issueNumber, title, solutionCount: (.stackOverflowSolutions | length)}' | head -50
